# AssessPrep-Security-Bypass
Damn, I was going to have a test in a few days and we needed to use the offline app, so I downloaded it and god damn .net non obfuscated pile of shit... took me 20 minutes to write an bypass for it. If any staff of assessprep is reading this please fix your shitty protection üôè.


How does this work?

I just deleted nearly all of the security code and it doesnt trigger anything cringe.


Is it safe for me to cheat in my exams using this?

Absolutely not, yes this is a bypass for its protection but why cheat in an exam? this is only made for memeing the "devs".
